A presentation written in [Marp](https://marp.app/) based on the [Marpstyle "King"](https://github.com/cunhapaulo/marpstyle/tree/main) theme.

To compile this, you'll need to install Marp and the theme in the appropriate spots. For instance: Install the [Marp VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) and add the theme to your `settings.json`:

```
"markdown.marp.themes": [
    "https://cunhapaulo.github.io/style/king.css"
  ],
```
